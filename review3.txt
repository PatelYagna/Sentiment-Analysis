"Jennifer is very nice and responsive. The location of the apt is great. However
- the bed was small and smelled bad. The apt also smelled weird. We had to sleep on a mattress on the floor
- the building is very old.
- the apt is not clean and due to construction it was very noisy.
However. We do appreciate the stay and the location"
