Garon is undoubtedly the most welcoming and nice host ever. You feel at home right away, he is exciting and passionate, discussions are super interesting and he is extremely friendly. A stay at his place is a good mood cure. I highly recommend!
It was so nice staying at Garon's! For the first glance it didn't look very fancy or something, but this place is gorgeous from inside out. It's pretty easy to get to subway G train or if you walk a little more you can get to A train which goes directly to JFK airport. Garon is a very kind person, very open-minded and friendly! We also have a lot in common in area of culture! I'll recommend this place to everyone who is open-minded and want to feel how people live there in NYC. Neighborhood looked safe. Despite it was one of the coldest weeks for last year in town, but heating worked well and the room was warm!
